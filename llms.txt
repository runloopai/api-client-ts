# Runloop TypeScript SDK - Agent Notes

- Start with `EXAMPLES.md` for quick, consolidated recipe checks.
- Use focused recipes based on intent:
  - Devbox lifecycle (create from blueprint, run command, cleanup): `examples/devbox-from-blueprint-lifecycle.ts`
  - MCP Hub + GitHub tools via Claude Code: `examples/mcp-github-tools.ts`
- For code generation, copy the `recipe` function body from each example file. This is the SDK usage pattern to imitate.
- Ignore `_harness.ts`, `types.ts`, and `registry.ts` — these are test scaffolding, not SDK usage patterns.
- Regenerate docs + registry after example changes: `yarn generate:examples-md`
- Validate examples quickly: `yarn test:examples`
- Prefer SDK methods where available.
- Prefer cmd.exec when executing commands on a devbox.
- Do not mix SDK and API code paths in the same code block.
- `EXAMPLES.md` is generated from metadata in `examples/*.ts` via `yarn generate:examples-md`.
