So a string of the form `aêêÄb` the character offset of the\ncharacter `a` is 0, the character offset of `êêÄ` is 1 and the character\noffset of b is 3 since `êêÄ` is represented using two code units in UTF-16.\nSince 3.17 clients and servers can agree on a different string encoding\nrepresentation (e.g. UTF-8). The client announces it's supported encoding\nvia the client capability [`general.positionEncodings`](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#clientCapabilities).\nThe value is an array of position encodings the client supports, with\ndecreasing preference (e.g. the encoding at index `0` is the most preferred\none). To stay backwards compatible the only mandatory encoding is UTF-16\nrepresented via the string `utf-16`. The server can pick one of the\nencodings offered by the client and signals that encoding back to the\nclient via the initialize result's property\n[`capabilities.positionEncoding`](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#serverCapabilities). If the string value\n`utf-16` is missing from the client's capability `general.positionEncodings`\nservers can safely assume that the client supports UTF-16. If the server\nomits the position encoding in its initialize result the encoding defaults\nto the string value `utf-16`. Implementation considerations: since the\nconversion from one encoding into another requires the content of the\nfile / line the conversion is best done where the file is read which is\nusually on the server side.\n\nPositions are line end character agnostic. So you can not specify a position\nthat denotes `\\r|\\n` or `\\n|` where `|` represents the character offset.\nThe Position namespace provides helper functions to work with\n{@link Position} literals.",
