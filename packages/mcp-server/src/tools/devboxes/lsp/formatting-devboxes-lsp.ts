The server can pick one of the\\nencodings offered by the client and signals that encoding back to the\\nclient via the initialize result\\'s property\\n[`capabilities.positionEncoding`](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#serverCapabilities).

If the server\\nomits the position encoding in its initialize result the encoding defaults\\nto the string value `utf-16`. Implementation considerations: since the\\nconversion from one encoding into another requires the content of the\\nfile / line the conversion is best done where the file is read which is\\nusually on the server side.\\n\\nPositions are line end character agnostic.
